# AutoEncoder
-> Various tasks(AUTOENCODER, DENOISE AUTOENCODERS) performed on datasets like mnist.

-> MLP vs CNN - Image Classification on the SVHN dataset and comparison of the results. 

-> For Occlusion Sensitivity Analysis, I took pretrained ResNet model from Torchvision, evaluated the models accuracy using various images.
